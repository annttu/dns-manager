DNSManager
==========

DNSManager uses TSIG-key to add, update and delete DNS-records. DNSmanager works with all DNS-servers which support Dynamic updates [(RFC2136)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2136) using secure transport [(RFC3007)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3007). For example Bind9 and PowerDNS are supported.


Installation
============

Prerequisites

 * Running postgresql server
 * Some packages
   * sudo apt-get install libpq-dev python3-dev ( debian, ubuntu, etc. )
   * sudo yum install postgresql-devel ( centos, redhat, etc. )

Install packages etc.

    virtualenv env --python=python3.4
    . env/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd DNSManager
    vi manager/settings.py
    ./manage.py makemigrations
    ./manage.py migrate
    # Create admin account for yourself
    ./manage.py createsuperuser


Usage
=====

    ./manage.py runserver

Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000

I strongly recommend to setup a reverse proxy with a SSL-support for
connections over Internet. Nginx or Apache is fine for this.

Docker
======

Build the image locally

    docker build . -t dns-manager

Initialize the database and create a super user account.

    docker-compose run app manage.py makemigrations
    docker-compose run app manage.py migrate
    docker-compose run app manage.py createsuperuser

Run the stack

    docker-compose up -d

Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000


Zone config for Bind9
=====================

Configuration for bind9 to allow dynamic updates using TSIG-key.

Create first TSIG-key.

    dnssec-keygen -a HMAC-SHA256 -b 256 -n HOST domain.tld.tsigkey
    cat domain.tld.tsigkey.*.key

Copy the bas64 encoded key and use to replace secret in <b>key</b> row below. Full row is also needed later when domain is added to the frontend.

Update zone config with following

    key "domain.tld.tsigkey." { algorithm hmac-sha256; secret "XC+/XU45WGC6ycCT9uORuqs+cPWqoyMl98F63Cw2czo="; };
    zone "domain.tld" { type master; file "/etc/bind/domain.tld"; allow-transfer { my-master-server-here; key "domain.tld.tsigkey."; }; allow-update { key "domain.tld.tsigkey."; }; };

Note to use exactly same name for key in config than in dnssec-keygen command. Otherwise it does not work.

Finally reload config

    rndc reload
